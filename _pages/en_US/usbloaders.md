USB loaders are homebrew applications which enable playing of backup games from external storage devices.
This page lists the differences between the two we recommend, so you can choose based on your needs.

#### Choose a USB loader

    * Can only load games from a USB drive
    * Can patch games on-the-fly for use with Wiimmfi
- [WiiFlow](wiiflow) <!-- page not written yet --!>
    * Supports FAT32 filesystem only <!-- I don't know if this is true, someone else please confirm --!>
