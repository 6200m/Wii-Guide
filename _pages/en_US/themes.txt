Are you tired of the boring, plain white theme on your Wii Menu, and want a cool theme instead? This tutorial will help you get a new theme for your Wii Menu!

In the case of a brick, [installing Priiloader is a must.](/priiloader) Also, install BootMii (as Boot2 if you have an early Wii). You should be fine if you do this tutorial correctly though.

#### What you need
* A Wii
* An SD card with at least 128 MB of free space
* A computer with Windows on it (or using Mono or Wine on Linux/Mac)
* [MyMenuify Mod](/assets/files/MyMenuifyModv1.5.zip)
* [ThemeMii Mod](http://adf.ly/6DhHK)
* [This GBAtemp post](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-theme-team-creations-v2.336596/)

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Finding a Theme

1. Peruse the GBAtemp post, finding a theme you want to install. Some have YouTube videos to show what the theme looks like, unfortunately some of them are unavailable.
1. Once you found one you like, click the download link corresponding to your Wii Menu version. **It is very important to pick the right one to avoid bricks.**
1. You probably will pick the download link that says 4.X, that means the theme will work on version 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Wii Menu.
1. Some themes have different links for different regions, so please pick the one corresponding to your Wii's region.
1. Once you downloaded the theme you want and double-checked you got the right one, open up ThemeMii Mod.

##### Section II - Building the Theme

1. A dialog box will pop up telling you to only install themes if you have brick protection. If you installed Priiloader and/or BootMii (see the warning at the start of this guide), press OK.
1. Go to `Tools` > `Download Base App` > Version of the Wii Menu you have installed > Region of the Wii Menu you have installed.

1. A dialog box will pop up asking you to enter in a value to create a key. Enter in what it says, it will create a key that will be used to decrypt the Wii Menu from Nintendo's servers.
1. A file selection box will ask you where to save the .app file (that is the Wii Menu file it downloaded). Save it to the directory where ThemeMii is in.
