Have you wanted to use the News or Forecast Channel, or exchange mail between Wiis, yet miss WiiConnect24 after shutdown? Fear no more, as RiiConnect24 is here to save the day!

[RiiConnect24's site is here.](https://rc24.xyz/)

RiiConnect24 doesn't work with the Wii U yet (although they are working on it), so please do not do this on a Wii U.
<br>
Also, right now only Wii Mail and the News and Forecast Channel work. There is not a need to try other Channels, as they won't work yet.
<br>
There is also not a need to install Channels such as the Everybody Votes Channel because when RiiConnect24 releases Channels like that, you will have to patch them for security purposes.
{: .notice--warning}

In order to install RiiConnect24 you must be on Wii Menu version 4.3, otherwise mail won't work.
{: .notice--info}

These instructions will assume you're using an SD card to install RiiConnect24, but you can use a USB storage device instead of an SD card for these steps if you want to.

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Patching IOS

[Do you have any problems with installing RiiConnect24 or do you want to ask us something? Mail us at: support@riiconnect24.net!](mailto:support@riiconnect24.net)
{: .notice--info}

[If you want to see how to use IOS Patcher, click here!](iospatcher)
{: .notice--info}

[If you want to see instructions on how to install patched IOS, click here!](wiimodlite)
{: .notice--info}

You will now patch your IOS, `IOS31` and `IOS80`. This is required to use the Channels we support to change an RSA key used to sign the files, and contains some patches for Wii Mail.

1. Open the IOS Patcher zip and run `patch.bat` if on Windows, or `patch.command` on Linux or MacOS.
If you want to download IOS Patcher directly (on Windows), open cmd.exe and paste this:
`powershell -command "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://kcrpl.github.io/Patchers_Auto_Update/IOS_Patcher/net_install.bat', 'net_install.bat')" & start net_install.bat` (You need to be on Windows 7 on newer.)
1. Follow the instructions it gives you. Upon it finishing, copy the `WAD` folder to your SD Card.
1. Extract Wii Mod Lite and WiiXplorer, and then copy them to the `apps` folder on your SD Card. Make sure to copy WiiXplorer as its own folder, not the standalone files inside.
1. Insert your SD card into your Wii, open the Homebrew Channel, and launch Wii Mod Lite.
1. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, go to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `WAD` folder.
1. When `IOS31.wad` is highlighted, press +, and then press A to install the WAD. Continue to do the same for `IOS80.wad`.
1. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
