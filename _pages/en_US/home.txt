## What is "homebrew"?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) refers to unofficial software for your Wii. It allows you to run homebrew games and programs, including emulators and tools, as well as using homebrew services.

In most cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using the LetterBomb or FlashHax exploit. There are also various other exploits in commercial games to get homebrew running.

## What can I do with homebrew?
