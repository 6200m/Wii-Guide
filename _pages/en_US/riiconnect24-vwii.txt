Guide to installing [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz) on your vWii (Virtual Wii on Wii U) with: CMOC/MCC, Nintendo Channel, EVC and News Channel along with forced 4:3 aspect ratio patching.

Since certain features found in the original Wii are not present in the vWii,
we can only partially utilize RiiConnect24. See [what's currently
working](#whats-currently-working) for details.

#### Warnings

We are **NOT** responsible if you brick, or damage your console in any way whatsoever. If you follow this guide exactly, you shouldn't have any problems.
{: .notice--danger}

Do **NOT** perform this guide on any other console than the vWii (Virtual Wii
on Wii U). If you're looking for instructions for a Nintendo Wii, use
[wii.guide/riiconnect24](riiconnect24).
{: .notice--danger}

The following is a list of things that can potentially **BRICK** your vWii (don't do these things!):
* Installing IOS for a Wii console on vWii.
* Installing Wii menu themes not formatted correctly for vWii and/or your region.
* Installing BootMii and/or Priiloader/Preloader.
* Failure during the install of crucial system/IOS titles (e.g. power outage).
* Modifying the vWii NAND without knowing what you are doing.
{: .notice--danger}

If you somehow happen to brick your vWii, [follow this guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/guide-vwii-unbrick-guide-by-garyodernichts.528329). ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200213194233/https://gbatemp.net/threads/guide-vwii-unbrick-guide-by-garyodernichts.528329/))

#### What you need

After following the above linked guide, you should have:
* **A vWii NAND backup and keys** (keep these stored safely!!)
* **The Homebrew Channel installed**

#### What's currently working?
The following RiiConnect24 services are **working** on the vWii:
* News Channel
    * This channel is affected by the timestamp issue. The "Last Updated" and article timestamps will be incorrect.
* Nintendo Channel
* Everybody Votes Channel
* Check Mii Out Channel / Mii Contest Channel
{: .notice--success}

The following RiiConnect24 services are **not working** on the vWii:
* Wii Friends/Address book (functionality does not exist on vWii)
    * This includes sending/receiving mail to/from friends. You can only receive global broadcast mail and posts from RSSMii feeds (if set up).
* Forecast Channel
    * This channel is affected by the timestamp issue. This is preventing the channel from getting past the loading screen, returning the `FORE000006` error.
* Everything else that isn't working according to [RiiConnect24 stats](https://rc24.xyz/stats/index.html).
