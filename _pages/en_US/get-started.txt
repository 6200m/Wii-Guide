These instructions will assume you're using an SD card to mod your Wii with, but you can use a USB storage device instead. However, the exploit LetterBomb requires a SD card due to how the Wii Message Board works.
{: .notice--info}

This guide is for the original Wii only, with the latest firmware (4.3). Do not use this on a Wii U (vWii)!
If you want to install homebrew on vWii, [follow this tutorial](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/vwii-modding).
{: .notice--warning}

### Choose an exploit to use

- [LetterBomb](letterbomb) - Exploit that uses the Wii Message Board
- [FlashHax](flashhax) - Exploit that uses the Internet Channel


Some alternatives to this guide are [ModMii (if you have Windows)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/modmii/) or [SetMiiUp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/setmiiup-from-stock-to-latest-softmod-in-less-then-5-10-minutes.459416/).
Both of these allow you to get started via a guide, however they do not install other services by default, which this guide shows.
