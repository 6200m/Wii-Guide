For modding the Wii, [we recommend using ModMii (if you have Windows)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/modmii/). It's a good tool, and you can get a guide generated with instructions.<br>
[SetMiiUp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/setmiiup-from-stock-to-latest-softmod-in-less-then-5-10-minutes.459416/) is also a good tool to get you started.<br>
However, these tools do not give instructions on how to install RiiConnect24 or Wiimmfi, so use the pages here to learn how to install it.

This guide is for the original Wii only, assuming you're using the latest firmware on your Wii. Do not use this on vWii (Wii Mode on a Wii U)!
If you want to install homebrew on a Wii U, [follow this tutorial](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/vwii-modding).
